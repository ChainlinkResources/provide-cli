# Provide CLI

A command-line interface for [Provide](https://provide.services). Full documentation is available [here](https://docs.provide.services). Language-specific API clients are available [here](https://github.com/provideservices).

## Developer Quickstart

1. Create an account [here](https://dawn.provide.services/sign-up) and accept the terms of service and privacy policy.

2. Get a precompiled binary for your platform, `go get` or `go install` `github.com/provideservices/provide-cli`. Precompiled binaries are available for [Windows](https://github.com/provideservices/provide-cli/tree/dev/bin/windows), [Mac OS](https://github.com/provideservices/provide-cli/tree/dev/bin/osx) and [linux](https://github.com/provideservices/provide-cli/tree/dev/bin/linux).

3. Authenticate: `provide-cli authenticate` - this will authorize and cache a Provide API token in your home directory and will be used by the CLI until you revoke it.

4. Use the CLI to register applications, provision infrastructure and more.

## Quickstart

Documentation forthcoming.
